# KiCad-Library
This is my personal KiCad component library. This repository is divided into multiple submodules. The two repositories for `Symbols` and `Footprints` are public, but `Datasheets` and `3D-Models` are private only. Because I want to prevent some licensing issues with third party 3D-Models and Datasheets.
